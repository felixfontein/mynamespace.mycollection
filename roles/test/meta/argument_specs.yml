    description:
      - A simple test role with a sophisticated argument spec that does nothing.
      - It mainly demonstrates role argument specs. The arguments are taken from another collection (guess which one!) and do not have any effect on this role.

      sops_version:
        default: latest
        description:
          - The version of sops to install.
          - Should be a version like C(3.7.2). The special value C(latest) will select the latest version available form the given source.
        type: str
      sops_source:
        default: auto
        description:
          - Determines the source from where sops is installed.
          - The value C(github) will install sops from the Mozilla sops releases on GitHub (U(https://github.com/mozilla/sops/releases/)).
          - The value C(system) will install sops from the system packages. Note that not all system package repositories support sops.
          - The value C(auto) will determine the best source to install sops from. Here, system package repositories are preferred over GitHub.

      sops_github_latest_detection:
        description:
          - When installing the latest sops version from GitHub, configures how the latest release is detected.
          - C(auto) tries C(api) first and then uses C(latest-release).
          - C(api) asks the GitHub API for a list of recent releases and picks the highest version.
          - C(latest-release) uses a not fully documented URL to retrieve the release marked as "latest" by the repository maintainers.
        type: str
        choices:
          - auto
          - api
          - latest-release

          - Token to provide when querying the GitHub API for the latest release. Without the token
            there are rather strict rate limits.
          - Should mainly be used in GitHub Actions.
